### FILE EXTENSIONS
# https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/extensions/

# Implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs the fileâ€™s media type based on its extension.
# For example, if the input is "cat.jpg", the output should be "image/jpeg".

# Be sure to handle different file extensions and their corresponding media types.

# ["cat.jpg"] should output: image/jpeg
# ["document.pdf"] should output: application/pdf
# ["song.mp3"] should output: audio/mpeg
# ["video.mp4"] should output: video/mp4
# ["unknownfile.xyz"] should output: application/octet-stream
