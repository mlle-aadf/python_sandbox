# Implement a program that prompts the user for a simple arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result.
# The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Be sure to handle different spacing and input formats.

# ["3 + 4"] should output: 7
# ["10 - 2"] should output: 8
# ["5 * 6"] should output: 30
# ["8 / 2"] should output: 4.0
