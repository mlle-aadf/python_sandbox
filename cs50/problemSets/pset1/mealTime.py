### MEAL TIME
# https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/meal/

# Implement a program that prompts the user for a time and then outputs whether itâ€™s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time.
# Breakfast time is between 7:00 and 8:00, lunch time is between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner time is between 18:00 and 19:00.

# Be sure to handle different time formats and input variations.

# ["7:30"] should output: breakfast time
# ["12:15"] should output: lunch time
# ["18:45"] should output: dinner time
# ["10:00"] should output: not meal time
