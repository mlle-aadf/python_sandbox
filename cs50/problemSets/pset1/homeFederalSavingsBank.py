# Implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. 
# If the greeting starts with "hello", output "$0". 
# If the greeting starts with an "h" (but not "hello"), output "$20". 
# Otherwise, output "$100".

# Be sure to vary the casing of your input and “accidentally” add spaces on either side of your input before pressing enter. 
# Your program should behave as expected, case- and space-insensitively.

# ["hello"] should output: $0
# ["Hello"] should output: $0
# ["hi"] should output: $20
# ["hey"] should output: $20
# ["what's up"] should output: $100
