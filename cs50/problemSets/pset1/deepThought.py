# Implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.

# Be sure to vary the casing of your input and “accidentally” add spaces on either side of your input before pressing enter. Your program should behave as expected, case- and space-insensitively.

# [42] should output: Yes
# [Forty-Two] should output: Yes
# [forty-two] should output: Yes
# [50] should output: No
