### VANITY PLATES
# https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2/plates/

# Implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then validates it based on specific rules.
# The program should output "Valid" if the plate is valid and "Invalid" otherwise.

# For example:
# Input: CS50
# Output: Valid

# Test cases:
# [CS50] should output: Valid
# [CS50P] should output: Invalid
# [CS] should output: Valid
# [CS50CS] should output: Invalid
